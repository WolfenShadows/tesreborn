<h3>OOC Basics</h3>
<ol class="c">
  <li>Treat others as they wish to be treated, this is the Platinum Rule.</li>
  <li>When in the RP channel, try to keep OOC chatter to a minimum, if you must use OOC, please use double parenthesis.
  <ul>
    <li>DO NOT use any other OOC signifier, as our chat parser only accepts double parenthesis.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<h3>Character Creation</h3>
<ol class="c">
  <li>Read all instructions <strong>before</strong> starting character creation.</li>
  <li>You may not begin play until <strong>after</strong> your character has been approved.</li>
</ol>
